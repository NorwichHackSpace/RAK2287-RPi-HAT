To facilitate easier debugging the software now allows for runtime configuration
of debugging levels. Previously this had to be done at compile time.

Available debug switches are:
debug_spi : SPI communication to concentrator
debug_reg : concentrator communication
debug_hal : HAL Layer
debug_gps : GPS
debug_lbt : Listen Before Talk
debug_pkt_fwd : Debug TTN connection setup
debug_jit : Show verbose JIT queue information
debug_jit_error : Show JIT errors
debug_beacon : Show beacon debugging
debug_log : Show JSON data for Semtech protocol

Enable debugging by adding below line to the (local/global) json configuration:
"debug_...": true,
